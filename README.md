# Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms

## Overview

Customer segmentation is an essential task for businesses to understand their customers' behavior and preferences. This project aims to develop a user interface (UI) for users to input customer data and apply clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) to segment customers based on their behavior. The goal is to group customers into clusters that share similar characteristics, which can then be used for targeted marketing and personalized services.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project contains customer information such as demographics, purchase history, and engagement levels. This data will be used for clustering customers into distinct segments based on their behavior.

## Requirements

- Python
- Flask or Streamlit (for web UI)
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
